This is a simple backup script primarily for linux (May work on others such as Mac and windows as long as you dont use mysql. However it has not been tested). Features include:

- Custom selection of multiple files and folder paths
- Mysql Dumps (currently via a sub process but will be upgraded to mysqlDB soon)
- Tar.GZ backups
- FTP and SFTP support

Future plans:

- Zip support
- Amazon S3 bucket support
- Dropbox support 
- Google Drive support
- Windows Sky Drive support
- Samba (Well maybeâ€¦samba is stupid)
- Upgrade to mysqldb and stop using sub processes
- Email selected address completion or error message

- File management
-- Meaning the script will control how many files are kept on the server and disk at a given time. (Meaning only, lets say 5 backups will be kept on the remote server no matter where that be)
