        <p><strong>Tool is Back In Developmentâ€¦err hopefully</strong>
This has peaked my interest again. Ive learned quite a bit more (Although not as much as I would like) about since I wrote this. I have an idea. for a new delivery system. Hopefully I get around to fixing it. </p>

<hr><p>This is a simple backup script primarily for linux (May work on others such as Mac and windows as long as you dont use mysql. However it has not been tested). I thought about just using 1 set of username variables, but this long list gives you flexibility and the ability to use multiple backup options (maybe Ill put this in a seperate file). Features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom selection of multiple files and folder paths</li>
<li>Mysql Dumps (currently via a sub process but will be upgraded to mysqlDB soon)</li>
<li>Tar.gz or zip backups</li>
<li>FTP and SFTP support</li>
<li>DropBox support</li>
<li>Amazon S3 support</li>
<li>Google Drive support</li>
</ul><p>Future plans:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade to mysqldb and stop using sub processes</li>
<li>Email selected address completion or error message (Pipe it to mail in linux for now)</li>
<li>File management
-- Meaning the script will control how many files are kept on the server and disk at a given time. (Meaning only, lets say 5 backups will be kept on the remote server no matter where that be)</li>
<li>Change over to 1 big class in transferProg.py</li>
<li>box.net support</li>
</ul><p>Scratched Plans (Unless someone really really wants it)</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows Sky Drive support (This is probably not possible)</li>
<li>Samba</li>
<li>NFS</li>
</ul>
