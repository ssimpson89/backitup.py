{"name":"BackItUp.py","tagline":"A python script that will eventually backup selected files,dump all databases, zip them up and ftp them over. ","body":"**Tool is Back In Developmentâ€¦err hopefully**\r\nThis has peaked my interest again. Ive learned quite a bit more (Although not as much as I would like) about since I wrote this. I have an idea. for a new delivery system. Hopefully I get around to fixing it. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is a simple backup script primarily for linux (May work on others such as Mac and windows as long as you dont use mysql. However it has not been tested). I thought about just using 1 set of username variables, but this long list gives you flexibility and the ability to use multiple backup options (maybe Ill put this in a seperate file). Features include:\r\n\r\n- Custom selection of multiple files and folder paths\r\n- Mysql Dumps (currently via a sub process but will be upgraded to mysqlDB soon)\r\n- Tar.gz or zip backups\r\n- FTP and SFTP support\r\n- DropBox support\r\n- Amazon S3 support\r\n- Google Drive support\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n\r\n- Upgrade to mysqldb and stop using sub processes\r\n- Email selected address completion or error message (Pipe it to mail in linux for now)\r\n- File management\r\n-- Meaning the script will control how many files are kept on the server and disk at a given time. (Meaning only, lets say 5 backups will be kept on the remote server no matter where that be)\r\n- Change over to 1 big class in transferProg.py\r\n- box.net support\r\n\r\n\r\nScratched Plans (Unless someone really really wants it)\r\n\r\n- Windows Sky Drive support (This is probably not possible)\r\n- Samba\r\n- NFS","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
